  					<p>There are three major Airports in the New York City area, two of which are in New York and one close by in New Jersey.</p>
  					<p>If you are coming to New York from out of the country you will most likely be flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) which lies South of the city near Queens. For easy access after your flight to the city itself, you can take the AirTrain. The Airtrain will take travelers straight from the airport to the city and close to main subway and train lines to get you to your destination once inside Manhattan.</p>
  					<p>The second airport located in New York is the La Guardia Airport (LGA). Most domestic flights will end here rather than JFK. LGA is also located in Queens but is much closer to the city itself. There are multiple bus and subway routes that can get you to the city and of course iconic New York cabs waiting to take you to your destination.</p>
  					<p>The 3rd and final airport is located in New Jersey, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is used for both international and domestic flights. With its location outside of New York it is less crowded but a little out of the way. In an effort to make EWR more accessible for tourists and travelers you can now take a NJ AirTrain into Manhattan from the airport.</p>

  			<p>New York City cabs are iconic. You often see in tv shows or movies people having a hard time catching a cab in NYC. Fortunately, it isn’t that hard in real life you just have to know what to look for.

There are easy to read signs that can tell you the status of a cab. Cabs can be three things On-Duty, Occupied, and Off-Duty. You can tell the difference between these cabs by looking at the light on the top of the cab.

	1.  An On-Duty cab will have just the center of the light on highlighting the cabs number.
	2. An Occupied cab will not have any lights on the top on. This means that someone is already in the cab and it 	    can’t stop for you.
	3. An Off-Duty cab will have all of its lights on the top on. Not only will the light highlighting the cab number be 	    on but the lights on the sides of the topper will be on as well.</p>
